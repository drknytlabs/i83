To deploy this solution, here is a stepwise approach:

1) Setting Up Web Scraping Tools

Firstly, to gather market data, you will need to set up web scraping tools. One of the most popular ones is Scrapy, a Python framework. You may also use BeautifulSoup, a Python library, or Puppeteer for Node.js users. Once this is first set, you can start gathering data from your competitor's websites and other online resources.

2) Analyzing Data 

The next step is to analyze the market data that you have acquired. Machine learning tools like TensorFlow or PyTorch can be set up for this purpose - they will process your data and identify the main keywords, products, services offered, and customer reviews. Further, natural language processing algorithms can be used to analyze and extract meaningful trends from the text data.

3) Name Generation

In this phase, you will have to use generative algorithms for naming. Tools like Namesmith could be used, or you can write a custom algorithm using a corpus of words associated with your brand and a set of mixing-rules. In Python, you can use libraries like NLTK or spaCy.

4) Checking Availability

Once the names are generated, they must be checked for availability. For this, web scrapers can be run on various domain registries like GoDaddy, Name.com, etc., to check whether a domain name with the generated name already exists. 

5) Deployment

After the steps are followed, ensure that you streamline your sequence of operations. Make sure each step can be triggered once the previous one ends. Automation tools like Jenkins or Bamboo would be needed for this process. They help in orchestrating the entire build and delivering the process with precision.

6) Review and Feedback Incorporation

Although not part of the automation, it is essential to involve relevant stakeholders at this point. They will review the brand names generated, select them, feedback on the process, and finalize the name and logo design. 

7) Legal Protection

Once a name is finalized, make sure to work closely with your legal team to ensure trademark registration and domain purchase. 

Keep in mind that most parts of this operation require a significant amount of programming knowledge, especially in Python, and a basic understanding of Machine Learning. 

The automation process makes the brand development process quicker, and significantly more efficient by helping analyze competitor data, generating brand names, and checking the availability of those names. Although the process has been automated, it is important to include the human touch in the process for the brand to connect with its audience. Branding professionals should be involved in finalizing and vetting the brand name and identity.

Apologies for the confusion earlier. I'd like to clarify that as an AI operations entity, I'm proficient in providing guidance on software deployment and its related tasks. Without further ado, here's a generic outline on how to deploy a software application:

1. **Preparation**: This is the first stage that includes creating the pre-deployment plan, outlining tasks, documenting the process, and ensuring all requisite system configurations are ready. Depending on the application, you may need to set up servers, databases, and other necessary infrastructure. 

2. **Testing**: Conduct thorough testing of the software in a controlled environment before pushing it to production. This involves unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing. Ensure the software performs as expected under different scenarios, using different data sets.

3. **Packaging**: Once the software has passed the testing phase, it is packaged for deployment. This might require containerizing software with platforms like Docker or setting up a continuous integration/continuous deployment pipeline with tools like Jenkins or Travis CI.

4. **Deployment**: Deploy the software onto the live environment. This could be done manually, but it is commonly executed through automated processes (like CI/CD pipelines). You could use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools, such as Ansible, Terraform, or Chef.

5. **Post-deployment testing and monitoring**: Once the software is deployed, perform another round of testing in the live environment to ensure everything works as expected. Keep a focus on the software's performance, uptime, and functionality by using Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools.

6. **Rollback plan**: Always have a rollback plan in case things don't go as planned after the deployment. 

7. **Maintenance and updates**: Software deployment is not a one-time activity. It requires regular updates and maintenance based on bug reports, user feedback, and new feature requests.
   
Please keep in mind this is a generic process, the actual steps can change based on the application to be deployed, the chosen technology, and the system for deployment. If you provide more details, I can give a more specific sequence of operations.

Deployment Steps:

1. Planning: The first step is to plan the structure or layout of the landing page, making sure it is responsive in design and will work optimally on all devices from mobiles to large desktop screens. Identify the key elements you need on the page such as headers, text, images, forms, and calls to action.

2. Designing: Use design and prototyping tools (Sketch, Figma, Adobe XD) to design the user interface of the landing page. This is a crucial step and should be done in consultation with the client to ensure it meets their needs.

3. Coding: Codes are written using a Text Editor such as Sublime Text, Atom or Visual Studio Code. Implement the design using a frontend framework of your choice (ReactJS, AngularJS, or Vue.JS) according to the design prototypes.

4. Backend: Setup the backend server using NodeJS, Django, Flask, etc. Develop the necessary APIs, server-side logic, and prepare the database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to manage and store data from your landing page.

5. Version Control: Important changes and iterations are tracked using a Version Control System like Git. This facilitates easy collaboration among team members and rollback to previous versions in case of bugs or issues.

6. Testing: Run unit, integration, and systems tests to ensure all functionalities work correctly. Check on various devices and browsers to ensure the page is truly responsive.

7. SEO Optimization: Use SEO tools like Google Analytics, Ahrefs, or SEMrush for search engine optimization to ensure the page can be easily discovered by your target audience.

8. Deployment: Once the landing page meets all the criteria, it is deployed on the server using cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.

9. Post-Deployment Monitoring: Use project management tools such as Trello, Jira, or Asana to track any post-deployment issues and to manage future updates or improvements.

10. Scalability: To ensure the design is scalable, follow modular programming practices. Use microservices for-backend operations, incorporate a load balancer to distribute traffic, and make use of cloud services that can easily be scaled up or down depending on traffic.

By following these steps, the landing page will be responsive, scalable, and ready to meet the needs of your growing business.
