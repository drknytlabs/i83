To deploy this solution, here is a stepwise approach:

1) Setting Up Web Scraping Tools

Firstly, to gather market data, you will need to set up web scraping tools. One of the most popular ones is Scrapy, a Python framework. You may also use BeautifulSoup, a Python library, or Puppeteer for Node.js users. Once this is first set, you can start gathering data from your competitor's websites and other online resources.

2) Analyzing Data 

The next step is to analyze the market data that you have acquired. Machine learning tools like TensorFlow or PyTorch can be set up for this purpose - they will process your data and identify the main keywords, products, services offered, and customer reviews. Further, natural language processing algorithms can be used to analyze and extract meaningful trends from the text data.

3) Name Generation

In this phase, you will have to use generative algorithms for naming. Tools like Namesmith could be used, or you can write a custom algorithm using a corpus of words associated with your brand and a set of mixing-rules. In Python, you can use libraries like NLTK or spaCy.

4) Checking Availability

Once the names are generated, they must be checked for availability. For this, web scrapers can be run on various domain registries like GoDaddy, Name.com, etc., to check whether a domain name with the generated name already exists. 

5) Deployment

After the steps are followed, ensure that you streamline your sequence of operations. Make sure each step can be triggered once the previous one ends. Automation tools like Jenkins or Bamboo would be needed for this process. They help in orchestrating the entire build and delivering the process with precision.

6) Review and Feedback Incorporation

Although not part of the automation, it is essential to involve relevant stakeholders at this point. They will review the brand names generated, select them, feedback on the process, and finalize the name and logo design. 

7) Legal Protection

Once a name is finalized, make sure to work closely with your legal team to ensure trademark registration and domain purchase. 

Keep in mind that most parts of this operation require a significant amount of programming knowledge, especially in Python, and a basic understanding of Machine Learning. 

The automation process makes the brand development process quicker, and significantly more efficient by helping analyze competitor data, generating brand names, and checking the availability of those names. Although the process has been automated, it is important to include the human touch in the process for the brand to connect with its audience. Branding professionals should be involved in finalizing and vetting the brand name and identity.

Apologies for the confusion earlier. I'd like to clarify that as an AI operations entity, I'm proficient in providing guidance on software deployment and its related tasks. Without further ado, here's a generic outline on how to deploy a software application:

1. **Preparation**: This is the first stage that includes creating the pre-deployment plan, outlining tasks, documenting the process, and ensuring all requisite system configurations are ready. Depending on the application, you may need to set up servers, databases, and other necessary infrastructure. 

2. **Testing**: Conduct thorough testing of the software in a controlled environment before pushing it to production. This involves unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing. Ensure the software performs as expected under different scenarios, using different data sets.

3. **Packaging**: Once the software has passed the testing phase, it is packaged for deployment. This might require containerizing software with platforms like Docker or setting up a continuous integration/continuous deployment pipeline with tools like Jenkins or Travis CI.

4. **Deployment**: Deploy the software onto the live environment. This could be done manually, but it is commonly executed through automated processes (like CI/CD pipelines). You could use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools, such as Ansible, Terraform, or Chef.

5. **Post-deployment testing and monitoring**: Once the software is deployed, perform another round of testing in the live environment to ensure everything works as expected. Keep a focus on the software's performance, uptime, and functionality by using Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools.

6. **Rollback plan**: Always have a rollback plan in case things don't go as planned after the deployment. 

7. **Maintenance and updates**: Software deployment is not a one-time activity. It requires regular updates and maintenance based on bug reports, user feedback, and new feature requests.
   
Please keep in mind this is a generic process, the actual steps can change based on the application to be deployed, the chosen technology, and the system for deployment. If you provide more details, I can give a more specific sequence of operations.
