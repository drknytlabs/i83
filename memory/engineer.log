As a senior software engineer, I can help you create an automated solution to execute some parts of your requirements. Specifically:

1) Automate market research: Web scraping tools can help gather data from various competitor websites and online resources. We can extract information such as keywords, customer reviews, products, and services offered, and categorize them for analysis.

2) Analyse brand identity: Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze the data obtained from the research step and outline your brand identity features. 

3) Name generation: I can also use generative algorithms that will generate unique and catchy brand names based on specific parameters linked to your brand's identity.

4) Availability check: Another possibility is to use web scraping tools to automatically check the availability of the proposed brand names online and their respective URLs on various domain registries.
   
However, for steps like defining your brand identity, brainstorming sessions, finalizing the name and logo design, gathering and assimilating feedback, and legal protection, you may need the expertise of professionals in branding, designing, and legal affairs. 

Also, it's worth noting that while automation can provide data and assistance, human creativity, expertise, and decision making are irreplaceable at various points in the process. The combination of both can provide a strong, unparalleled outcome.

I'm sorry but it seems like you've mistaken the context. As a software engineer, creating a pitch deck isn't within my range of responsibilities. I am more inclined towards designing, creating and implementing software programs, systems or algorithms based on the requests or needs of the project. 

If you need a software system or program to be developed, or you're encountering an issue with your current software, feel free to share the details and I'll gladly provide solutions or create the necessary software for you.

11. Code Review and Refactoring: Periodically review the code to ensure that it is clean, efficient and maintainable. This will involve rewriting or rearranging parts of the code to improve its performance or readability.

12. Security Measures: Implement security protocols to protect the landing page from potential threats or hacking attempts.

13. Browser Compatibility: Make sure the landing page is compatible with all major browsers and resolve any discrepancies or issues.

14. Accessibility Compliance: Ensure the landing page is accessible to users of all abilities. This includes features for visually impaired users such as text-to-speech and high contrast color schemes.

15. Maintenance and Troubleshooting: Routinely check the landing page for bugs or errors. Quick response times to any issues can ensure a smooth user experience.

16. Version Control: Use a version control system to manage changes to the source code. This ensures that every change made to the site is documented and can be rolled back if need be.

17. Documentation: Document all actions taken as well as their results. This information can prove invaluable for troubleshooting, knowledge sharing and future projects.

18. Training: If the client wishes to manage their own landing page, provide training to ensure they understand how to use the back-end software.

That's absolutely correct! Here's how to convert your strategy to code:

1. Understand the User Needs and Concerns: This step is not directly related to coding but the insights obtained here will define how we create the signup flow.

2. Define the Signup Flow Elements: You create an HTML form with the following elements:
    - Email input field: `<input type="email" name="email">`
    - Password input field: `<input type="password" name="password">`
    - Password confirmation field: `<input type="password" name="confirm_password">`
    - Checkbox for acceptance of terms and conditions: `<input type="checkbox" name="terms_and_conditions">`
    - Signup button: `<input type="submit" value="Sign Up">`
    - Link for existing users to sign in: `<a href="signin.html">Already have an account? Sign in</a>`

3. Wireframe the Signup Flow: This is also not directly related to coding but will define the structure of our HTML file.

4. Define Interactions: This will be done in JavaScript. For example, to validate the email entered by the user, you could use a function like this:
```javascript
function validateEmail(email) {
    var re = /^(([^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+(\.[^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)*)|(".+"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/;
    return re.test(String(email).toLowerCase());
}
```

5. Writing the Copy: This can be done directly in the HTML file or in a separate content strategy document.

6. Test the Signup Flow: You can perform functional testing manually or by writing automated tests using tools like Jest or Mocha.

7. Implementation: Now, you may implement the client-side in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and server-side in a language of your choice. For secure storage of user data, you should use Hashing algorithms like bcrypt.

8. Review and Revive: Perform user testing, A/B testing and update designs or functionalities as required.

Remember, while coding every aspect of signup flow, considering user experience and security at every step is the key to build an effective and efficient signup flow.
